# Roguelike

Roguelike game

This is a simple roguelike.  If you'd like to try it out, download and extract the zip file from 'releases' or from this: https://github.com/cwzero/Roguelike/releases/tag/fp_1

Requires java 8+ to be installed (might need a higher version, I haven't tested it on anything other than adoptopenjdk-hotspot-14)

Extract the zip file, go into Roguelike/bin and run the batch file (for windows) or the bash script on mac/linux

The objective of the game is to descend through the dungeon, to the lowest level without dying.

It's currently buggy, if you can't proceed or it locks up/crashes, try restarting the game.  It should be possible to reach the bottom level most of the time.

WASD to move, F to descend stairs(>), R to ascend the stairs(<)
P to pick up items on the ground

Walk into doors (+) to open them, or walk into enemies to fight them.

b are bats which can damage/kill you
the little white things are gems, the more you collect the better you do.  Unfortunately, the UI to tell you how much you collected is not working quite yet.

Currently in early prototype phase/unfininished.
